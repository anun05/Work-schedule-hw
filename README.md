## Description
The purpose of this project was to crete a day planner for those who like schedule out their day and see what they need to do/look forward too. The way the assingment is structured is there are time slots and text boxes where the user can select a time and type in the text box to write out what they need to do through out the day. After inputting what they are going to do, they can save it so when they leave the site and return their task is still there. Another display in the project is if the time is present the color will appear red letting the user know this is a current time slot, if it is grey, then it was a past time slot, and if it is green, it is a future time slot. The motivation I had through out to building this assignment was I wanted to continue to learn and I feel like I have gotten a better hang of it, I feel like this project will become a turning point.[
